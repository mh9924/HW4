# HW4
Project

# Checklist
- [x] **Part I** - Read in and paint circle/filled-in circle in addition to line drawing
- [x] **Part II** - Have Painting accept Line2D objects in addition to MyLine/circles. Program should have same behavior as HW2 (can read in legacy test files).
- [ ] **Part III** - Draft the appearance of an interface that would allow the user to draw anything allowed by Graphics2D. Add stub fields/methods. Create a UML png reflecting these fields/methods.
